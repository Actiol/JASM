To start JASM run "JASM - Just Another Skin Manager.exe" inside JASM folder. You will then be prompted by a startup screen that will guide you.

JASM is a Skin Manager, not a mod injector. It helps manage mod folders by organizing and displaying them. 3Dmigoto is the loader responsible for injecting mods into Genshin.

Updating from previous versions: 

From Version 1.4.3 and upwards -> Click the update button at the bottom of the settings page.

						OR

1. Download JASM.
2. Delete the old JASM folder and replace it with the new one. 

Personal settings are stored in "C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\JASM\ApplicationData" or in the mods themselves
